# mad-mobile-app

This is part of Alexandre Czechowicz's Code test.

## Some notes to reach the goals 📢:
   1. in order to handled styles, only plain css, also React Styled components;
   2. in order to handled state, only used React Context - no Redux, Recoil, or whatever...;
   3. in order to bundle it, Vite was the option;
   4. Thanks;

## Final notes 👁️‍🗨️:

* For the porpose of this exercise, was not use any kind of image/file upload - in real world app, for sure this is a must have to get on user edit form;
* Also, was not implemented any kind of test - again, in a real world app, is a must have, such as : Jest, Cypres, etc...

### To get start:
    ✔️ run yarn or npm command to install the pack dependecies;
    ✔️ run 'yarn vite' or 'npm run vite';
